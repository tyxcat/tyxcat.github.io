Hello! 👋 I'm Cady, a Software Engineer at Google DeepMind. 🌀 As part of the GenAI team, I am currently focused on building LLM agents, exploring how they can be used to solve complex real-world problems. My goal is to develop highly capable and reliable agents that can interact intelligently with dynamic environments.

Before joining DeepMind, I was a Machine Learning Engineer on the Google XR team. 🕶️ There, my work centered on the research and development of Perception Models and Multimodal LLMs to enhance XR experiences, making user interactions more intuitive and contextually aware.

Prior to my roles at Google, I served as a Software Engineer at Apple  on the CoreOS team. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.

I am always happy to connect with other researchers and practitioners working on LLMs, XR, or autonomous agents. Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadyxu/), [Email](mailto:[tyx@google.com]), or explore my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=nx1V8M4AAAAJ) for potential collaborations! 🐑

<!-- I am actively seeking student researchers and interns to collaborate with me for the Summer 2026 term. If you have a strong background in machine learning (especially multimodal models), computer vision, or LLMs and are passionate about building the next generation of intuitive AR experiences, please feel free to reach out. -->
