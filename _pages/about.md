Hello! 👋 I am a researcher on the <a href='https://research.google/people/cadyxu/'>Google AR</a> team, where my work focuses on the development and application of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). My research aims to build more intuitive and contextually aware Extended Reality (XR) experiences, leveraging the power of multimodal understanding to enhance how users interact with and perceive their digital and physical environments.

In addition to my work at Google, I am currently a Master's student in the Machine Learning program (MSML) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Previously, I was a software engineer at Apple on the Core Operating System (CoreOS) team. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.

I am actively seeking student researchers and interns to collaborate with me for the Summer 2026 term. If you have a strong background in machine learning (especially multimodal models), computer vision, or LLMs and are passionate about building the next generation of intuitive AR experiences, please feel free to reach out.
